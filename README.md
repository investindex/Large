# Concerns for the large investor

In his 2016 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:

“Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.

That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.

The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them something superior compared to what the masses receive.

In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason, the financial “elites” — wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like — have great trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.”

Wealthy individuals naturally find it easier to pay for expert personalized advice, which is [undoubtedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI5p8vqdjTw&ab_channel=BenFelix) [valuable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeTsh--UEe4&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) to many people. But they have special access to very few investment opportunities that most people would want, if they understood the risks and likely returns. As Buffett emphasized, there are also many advisors who are incentivized to sell you high-fee products which generate profits for them at the expense of their clients. So you cannot seek professional advice without understanding that some advisors are predatory or [uninformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlpwTJJEasA&ab_channel=BenFelix). Be skeptical of exclusive offers.

Of course, people with almost any level of income and wealth can use professional financial advice.
